"""
Problem:
Delivery company has 2 warehouses and needs to supply 3 stores.
Minimize transportation gosts.

* Warehouse A has 100 units available
* Warehouse B has 150 units available
* Store 1 needs 80 units
* Store 2 needs 70 units
* Store 3 needs 90 units.

Transportation costs per unit:
* From warehouse A, $2 to store 1, $3 to store 2, $4 to store 3
* From warehouse B, $5 to store 1, $1 to store 2, $2 to store 3

Determine how many units to ship from each warehouse to each store to minimize total cost
while meeting all demands.
