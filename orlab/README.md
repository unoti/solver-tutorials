## Setup and Installation

[OR Tools Python Install](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install)

```
cd ortools
uv sync
```

Note about virtual environments:

When using `uv` you don't need to explicitly activate your venv.
Instead consider using for example `uv run python exercise5.py`
which will automatically run that in the virtual environment that `uv` set up for you.

To run in notebooks, you will need to select the Python interpreter from the `.venv`
it created for you.
