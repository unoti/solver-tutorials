    "I considered a few ways to model the production line compatibility:\n",
    "1. **Normal constraint approach**.  For products that cannot be produced on a given line, we make constraints that say the sum of those decision variables must be zero.  Consider the item \"Premium Boards\" which can only be made on line A.  We can introduce constraints that say that the total production of these boards on line B and C must be zero.  \n",
    "2. **In Production Coefficients**.  When we are going to make an item on a line, we're going to introduce a constraint that says the total items produced >= the demand for that item.  If I line can't manufacture an item, we can multiply it by `can_produce(line, item)` which is 0 or 1, and thus we won't count things in the plan that are produced on an incompatible line. This will make the solver automatically not select these plan items, because they won't satisfy any demand.\n",
    "3. **\"Hard Coded\" Decision Variables**.  If a given line can't produce an item, we can put in a numeric 0 instead of a decision variable.  If we use this technique we'll need to remember to check if a variable is a number instead of a decision variable, and either need to use the value as a number directly, or call `.solution_value()` on it.\n",
    "4. **Sparse Decision Variables**.  The is a variant of solution 3. If we determine that a given line cannot produce a given item, we *don't generate a decision variable for it*.  Then we don't have to make a constraint to eliminate it like we did in solution 1 above.  But we do need to check if `x_vars[line, slot, item] is not None` before we try to use it, since not all of them will be set."

    "\n",
    "We have this challenge in the rules of the problem that say that we must pay a one-time setup cost for a given production line if we're going to make any of an item on a production line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll introduce a set of decision variables, one per combination of line + product, which can be either 0 or 1.  Then we'll add constraints to force those values to be turned on if and only if any of the items are made on those lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, we want to introduce a set of variables called `pay_setup[line, item]`. Then we want to do something like `IF make[slot, line, item] = 1 THEN pay_setup[line, item] = 1`.  But unfortunately we can't do that directly, so we have to coax the solver into doing that for us by adding constraints.  There's a trick that's commonly used for one-time setup situations like this as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll do 3 steps:\n",
    "1. **Introduce decision variables** `pay_setup[line, item]` which are 0-1 binary variables indicating if we're paying the setup cost on the given line for the given product.\n",
    "2. **Introduce constraints.**  We will make a constraint for every `make[slot, line, item] <= pay_setup[line, item]`. This will force the pay_setup to be set to 1 for the line, item if *any* of the `make[slot, line, item]` are 1.  There's actually a trick we must do here, because we must have all the variables on the left side of the inequality. (If we needed variables on both sides of the inequality this would be quadratic instead of linear.) To do that, subtract `pay_setup` from both sides, which is why you'll see the coefficient go negative. So the constraint we'll actually do will be structured as `make[slot, line, item] - pay_setup[line, item] <= 0`. See more details about this constraint expression below.\n",
    "3. **Add costs to objective function**.  We're actually maximizing profit in this problem, so this means we will need to update our profit objective function to *subtract* the setup costs, by supplying negative coefficients for the setup costs as part of our objective function."
